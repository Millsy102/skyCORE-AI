# **ðŸ¤– Using AI in Your Plugins â€” A Manifesto**

In skyCORE-AI OS, every plugin must use artificial intelligence â€” because thatâ€™s the entire purpose of this platform.

Whether itâ€™s smart or silly, simple or powerful â€” we want AI in everything.

## **âœ… Ways to Use AI in Plugins**

- Use `use_model("model_id")` to load a HuggingFace model
- Call `smart_selector.infer_best("prompt")` to route decisions
- Connect to your own LLM via Colab or API
- Use ChatGPT for logic generation
- Use Claude or open-source tools to write/edit code
- Train new behaviors via prompt chaining
- Connect local models and offload tasks

## **ðŸ’¡ Think Creative**

- AI weather bot that reports forecasts in anime voice
- AI plugin that writes plugins
- AI code refactorer that rewrites itself

Push it. Letâ€™s find the edges.
