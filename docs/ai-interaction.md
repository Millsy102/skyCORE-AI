## 🧠 Natural Language Control (No Slash Commands Needed)

While skyCORE-AI supports structured slash commands (like `/file edit`, `/model gpt-4`, etc.), you **don’t need them** if you prefer to speak naturally.

The AI understands context, intent, and file/project awareness through its **interpretation engine**.

### ✅ Examples:

Say this:
> “Can you fix the indentation in skydev_tab.py?”

Or:
> “Switch to Claude and refactor this plugin to use async I/O.”

Or:
> “Build me a plugin that translates CSV files to JSON and preview the UI.”

Behind the scenes, skyCORE-AI will:
- Parse your instruction
- Determine required actions
- Route them to the correct models, files, or plugin handlers

### 💬 Use commands *only* when precision matters — skyCORE-AI understands the rest.
